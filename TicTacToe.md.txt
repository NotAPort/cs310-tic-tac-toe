TicTacToe.md

This project uses a GUI program to give the user the ability
to play tic tac toe against a computer.
The project was a class assignment that was used to reinforce
our knowledge of classes and GUI programming.
The program uses inputs from the user's mouse cursor to mark a board
and compute whether or not the game is over or not.
The program is split into 5 files, which are TicTacToe.java,
TicTacToeController.java, TicTacToeModel.java, TicTacToeMove.java, TicTacToeView.java.
